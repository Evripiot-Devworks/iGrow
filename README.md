# iGrow
A self-development project inspired by iWoM ("I Work On Myself").

## About

iGrow is my personal journey and implementation of the self-development concept originally founded as iWoM by [Anastasios Ektoroglou (Tassiioo)](http://github.com/Tassiioo). This repository is devoted to tracking my growth, exploring new skills, and experimenting with improvement strategies to become a better version of myself. iGrow is not a copy—it is my unique adaptation and workflow.

## Features

- Track habits and progress over time.
- Document techniques, reflections, and learning resources.
- Integrate simple scripts or workflows for productivity.
- Personal notes and ideas on self-improvement.

## Motivation

This project began as a commitment to improve myself, documenting every step and sharing lessons learned. Inspired by iWoM, iGrow represents my own philosophy, tools, and systems.

## Getting Started

Join me in building a supportive community where people grow and become the greatest versions of themselves—through their own effort and by sharing our mutual knowledge. This repository is a living workspace for experimentation and collaboration, and everyone is welcome to contribute new ideas, insights, and encouragement as we move forward together.
